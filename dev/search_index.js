If you call a mocked function with keyword arguments, it will dispatch to the original function. For more details, see Cassette#48.\n\nExamples\n\nMocking a single function:\n\nf(x) = x + 1\nmock(+) do plus\n    @assert plus isa Mock\n    @assert f(0) != 1  # The call to + is mocked.\n    @assert called_once_with(p, 0, 1)\nend\n\nMocking a function with a custom Mock:\n\nmock((+) => Mock(; return_value=1)) do plus\n    @assert 1 + 1 == 1\n    @assert called_once_with(plus, 1, 1)\nend\n\nMocking methods that match a given signature:\n\nmock((+, Float64, Float64) => Mock(; side_effect=(a, b) -> 2a + 2b)) do plus\n    @assert 1 + 1 == 2\n    @assert 2.0 + 2.0 == 8\n    @assert called_once_with(plus, 2.0, 2.0)\nend\n\nMocking with something other than a Mock:\n\nmock((+) => (a, b) -> 2a + 2b) do _plus\n    @assert 1 + 2 == 6\nend\n\nUsing Filters\n\nOftentimes, you mock a function with a very specific idea of where you want that mocking to happen. It can be confusing when a call you didn't anticipate gets mocked somewhere deep in the call stack, botching everything. To avoid this, you can use filter functions like so:\n\nf(x, y) = x + y\ng(x, y) = f(x, y)\nmock((+) => Mock(; side_effect=(a, b) -> 2a + 2b); filters=[max_depth(2)]) do plus\n    @assert f(1, 2) == 6  # The call depth of + here is 2.\n    @assert g(3, 4) == 7  # Here, it's 3.\n    @assert called_once_with(plus, 1, 2)\nend\n\nFilter functions take a single argument of type Metadata. If any filter rejects, then mocking is not performed. See Filter Functions for a list of included filters, as well as building blocks for you to create your own.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Filter-Functions-1","page":"Home","title":"Filter Functions","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"max_depth\nmin_depth\nexcluding\nincluding\nMetadata\ncurrent_depth\ncurrent_function\ncurrent_module","category":"page"},{"location":"#SimpleMock.max_depth","page":"Home","title":"SimpleMock.max_depth","text":"min_depth(n::Int) -> Function\n\nCreate a filter that rejects when the current call depth is greater than n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SimpleMock.min_depth","page":"Home","title":"SimpleMock.min_depth","text":"min_depth(n::Int) -> Function\n\nCreate a filter that rejects when the current call depth is less than n.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SimpleMock.excluding","page":"Home","title":"SimpleMock.excluding","text":"excluding(args...) -> Function\n\nCreate a filter that rejects when the calling function or module is in args.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SimpleMock.including","page":"Home","title":"SimpleMock.including","text":"including(args...) -> Function\n\nCreate a filter that rejects when the calling function or module is not in args.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#SimpleMock.Metadata","page":"Home","title":"SimpleMock.Metadata","text":"Container for mocks and bookkeeping data.
